# Type-Or-Py
An automatic answer program for the game Type or Die on Roblox. All questions that are missing or incorrectly read are complied to missing_questions.txt to be added. Works best in normal gamemode, many pro questions are missing or improperly formatted.

# Directions
Make sure that the game is maximixed (or at least on the top half of the screen). Once in game, when a new question pops up, click on the text box and press F8. The question will be processed and automatically answered (unless the question is not in the database, which case it will add it to missing_questions).

# Todo
Some questions in q&a.csv are shortened to be more searchable however this format does not work with the program. Need to go through and fix questions as issues arise

# Disclaimer
I do not condone cheating.
